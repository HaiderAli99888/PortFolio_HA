        <h2>Birth Of Cricket</h2>
        <p>Cricket is believed to have begun possibly as early as the 13th century as a game in which country boys
            bowled at a tree stump or at the hurdle gate into a sheep pen. This gate consisted of two uprights and a
            crossbar resting on the slotted tops; the crossbar was called a bail and the entire gate a wicket. The fact
            that the bail could be dislodged when the wicket was struck made this preferable to the stump, which name
            was later applied to the hurdle uprights. Early manuscripts differ about the size of the wicket, which
            acquired a third stump in the 1770s, but by 1706 the pitch—the area between the wickets—was 22 yards long.
        </p>
        <p>The ball, once presumably a stone, has remained much the same since the 17th century. Its modern weight of
            between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces (156 and 163 grams) was established in 1774.</p>

        <h2>My Favourite Cricketer</h2>
        <p>Few would dispute that Imran was the finest cricketer Pakistan has produced, or the biggest heartthrob.
            Suave, erudite and monstrously talented, he gave cricket in the subcontinent real sex appeal in the 1970s
            and 1980s. As such he and TV completed the popularisation of the game in his country which Hanif Mohammad
            and the radio had begun. Thousands, if not millions, who had never dreamt of bowling fast on heartless baked
            mud suddenly wanted to emulate Imran and his lithe bounding run, his leap and his reverse-swinging yorker.
            He also made himself into an allrounder worth a place for his batting alone, and captained Pakistan as well
            as anyone, rounding off his career with the 1992 World Cup. He played hardly any domestic cricket in
            Pakistan: instead he just flew in for home series from Worcestershire or Sussex, or rather from the more
            fashionable London salons. His averages (37 with the bat, 22 with the ball) put him at the top of the
            quartet of allrounders (Ian Botham, Richard Hadlee and Kapil Dev being the others) who dominated Test
            cricket in the 1980s. And whereas Botham declined steadily, Imran just got better and better: in his last 10
            years of international cricket he played 51 Tests, averaging a sensational 50 with the bat and 19 with the
            ball. He gave no quarter during some memorable battles with West Indies - Pakistan drew three series with
            them at a time when everybody else was being bounced out of sight - and he led Pakistan to their first
            series victory in England in 1987, taking 10 for 77 with an imperious display in the decisive victory at
            Headingley.</p>

        <h2>2017 Champions Trophy</h2>

        <p>As hosts, England qualified for the competition automatically; they were joined by the seven other
            highest-ranked teams in the ICC ODI Championship as at 30 September 2015.
            The eight participating teams were required to announce a 15-member squad for the tournament on or before 25
            April 2017. Teams could make changes to their originally named squads up to 25 May 2017, after which
            date changes would only be accepted on medical grounds, subject to approval.
            The 2017 ICC Champions Trophy was the eighth ICC Champions Trophy, a cricket tournament for the eight
            top-ranked One Day International (ODI) teams in the world. It was held in England and Wales from 1 to 18
            June 2017. Pakistan won the competition for the first time with a 180-run. The margin of victory was the
            largest by any team in the final of an ICC ODI tournament in terms of runs.</p>

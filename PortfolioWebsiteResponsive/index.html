        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>My name is Haider Ali. I was born in Kallar Kahar, Pakistan. I had my early education in Pakistan and then i
            moved to Canada for higher studies at St. Clair College.</p>
        <p>I am an aspiring web developer. I was always fascinated by technology and
            programming, which led me to enroll in this program. I'm excited to be part of this program and learn more
            about web development. I believe that having a better
            understanding of web development will help me communicate more effectively with developers. In the
            future, I hope to continue to improve my language capabilities and become useful for various
            industries and communities.</p>
        <p>After completing this program, I hope to work as a front-end developer and eventually move into
            full-stack development.</p>

                <h2>Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is
                        one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022,
                        98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often
                        incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
                        engine to execute the code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time
                        compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                        standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
                        functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
                        styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
                        expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
                    <p>The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now
                        embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and
                        non-browser applications.

                        Initial attempts at promoting server-side JavaScript usage were Netscape Enterprise Server and
                        Microsoft's Internet Information Services, but they were small niches.Server-side
                        usage eventually started to grow in the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other
                        approaches.

                        Electron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many
                        applications with behavior implemented in JavaScript. Other non-browser applications include
                        Adobe Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents and GNOME Shell extensions written in
                        JavaScript.

                        JavaScript has recently begun to appear in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js
